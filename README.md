# Advent of Code 2022

I'm solving one coding puzzle a day for 25 days with [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/)

Focusing on TDD, currently using JavaScript for speed and will switch to TypeScript and/or Java for practice in the following days.

[Day 1 - Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) ⭐⭐\
[Day 2 - Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) ⭐⭐\
[Day 3 - Rucksack Reorganisation](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) ⭐⭐

Thank you [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), who writes these fun puzzles for all of us to enjoy.
